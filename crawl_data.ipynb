      "Shoppers are also being squeezed by higher prices at the grocery store, with food prices experiencing modest upticks last month, according to thenewest inflation report.\n",
      "“Stop & Shop has evaluated its overall store portfolio and made the difficult decision to close underperforming stores to create a healthy base for the future growth of our brand,” said the chain’s president Gordon Reid in a release.\n",
      "Ahold Delhaize, the chain’s Dutch parent company, revealed the locations Friday adding that they will close in early November. The closures come amid a broader shake up in the US grocery industry including the rise of low-cost grocery brand Aldi, which plans to openopen 800 locations.In addition, Kroger and Albertson’s announced plans for a$25 billion mergerearlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block it.\n",
      "Ahold Delhaize announced in May at its investor day that store reductions were planned, but didn’t specify locations. The affected stores span all five states it has locations in, including 10 in New Jersey, eight in Massachusetts, seven in New York, five in Connecticut plus two locations in Rhode Island.\n",
      "Stop & Shop said it “remains committed to serving its communities through other store locations, online shopping and home delivery services.” Employees impacted by the closures will be offered other opportunities in the company.\n",
      "Following the closures, the 110-year-old chain said it will “continue to have a strong presence across its five-state footprint with more than 350 stores.” Stop & Shop has remodeled about half of its locations since 2018, with those refreshed stores “outperforming” the ones that haven’t been updated.\n",
      "In addition to operating Stop & Shop, Ahold Delhaize owns Food Lion and Giant grocery stores in the US.\n",
